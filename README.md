# Code Prism

## ðŸ”— What is it?

**Code Prism extension** is a tool that can record and store various information generated during code analysis.

When we analyze the code, many meta-data could occur, such as summary of what we analyzed, what to do, additional requests, related documents and so on. These metadata could be written and stored in a separate file, but keeping these meta-data as a separate file is very cumbersome and, above all, very inefficient because meta-data and code are not interconnected.

This extension is for these cases, _this extension manage these meta-data associated with code without modifying the code._

In fact, Code Prism is not just for source code, it is for all documents. so it allows you to leave the necessary comments on all kinds of documents(.md, .json, etc.) as well as the source code

Code Prism is basically a code review program. but it's simple to use and includes useful features for code analysis.

**_Enjoy!_**

## ðŸ”— Concept

The prism file and the document correspond one-to-one, and one prism file may contain multiple `Issue`s.

`Issue` is opinions on specific parts of the document. Therefore, `Issue` is linked to specific parts of the document and can have multiple `Note`s.

`Note` is opinion and information, it can be simple text, link, image, video and document.
